Plan of attack:

Right now dateSearch() is messed up.  After we fix this, we'll make a release.

Then
Every new feature implemented gets its own branch
Every new feature gets a specific test case written for it
Upon passing test, merge to master

organization:
columns:
a - id number
b - category
c - amount
d - note
e - wallet
f - currency
g - date
